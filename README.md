# RestartHomeseer
Powershell script for restarting the homeseer 3 

Must be run as administrator

Not sure what version of powershell you need to have to run it. 

If you have HS3.exe installed somewhere else than "C:\Program Files (x86)\HomeSeer HS3\" then you need to edit CheckIfHomeseerIsRunning.ps1 and insert the right path and directory in -FilePath and -WorkingDirectory
